1. Can't bind to 'errorStateMatcher' since it isn't a known property of 'input'.(auth-form-component.html)
    - import MatInputModule.

4. Issue when using store in app.module.ts
    core.js:5980 ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(AppModule)[AuthService -> Store -> Store -> Store]: 
    NullInjectorError: No provider for Store!

    Cause: we have used Store class in app.component.ts -> but we haven't declared it as Injectable for DI.

            export class Store { ... }

    Resolution:
        1. Decorate with Injectable and declare it as providein root

            @Injectable({
                providedIn: 'root'
            })
            export class Store { ... }

        2. declare this class directly into providers array of app.module.ts and store being normal class

            export class Store { ... }  

            providers:[   Store   ],
            export class AppModule { }
